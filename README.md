# Item Name Localized

[Download it on Curse](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/item-name-localized)

ItemNameLocalized is an addon that allows you to see on the items tooltips their name in a different language, always keeping the original name

Now you can tell to that friend that plays WoW with a different language than you  the name of that item you looted or find it on AMR upgrade finder.

The addon has a 20~MB of memory usage since it has all the item names of the selected locale in the memory. The other available locales are "deleted" to free memory when the addon is loaded, so selecting other locale from the options menu will require an UI reload to get the new item names loaded.

All names and ids are obtained from the official api, if some item is not localized in some locale, tell me and I will try to add it as soon as possible.
